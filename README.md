# 🧬 Psoriasis and Cancer Risk: A Mendelian Randomization Analysis

## 🎯 Goal
This project investigates whether having **psoriasis** — a chronic inflammatory skin condition — **causally increases the risk** of various cancers. Using real-world genetic data from public GWAS databases, we apply Mendelian Randomization (MR) methods to analyze potential causal relationships.

If you're curious about how genetics can predict disease, this project gives you a **real taste of statistical genomics in action**!

---

## 💡 What is Mendelian Randomization (MR)?

Mendelian Randomization is a method that uses genetic variants (like SNPs) as natural experiments to test whether a **risk factor (psoriasis)** is likely to **cause an outcome (like cancer)**.  
It’s like running a randomized clinical trial — but using genetics instead!

We used **four major MR methods**:
- **Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW)**
- **MR-Egger Regression**
- **Weighted Median**
- **Weighted Mode**

## 🛠️ What Does This Project Include?

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `main.py` | The main driver for running MR analysis |
| `gwas.py` | Contains all the MR calculation functions |
| `run.sh` | Bash script to run the entire pipeline |
| `datasets/` | Contains cancer GWAS summary statistics |
| `psoriasis/` | Contains GWAS data related to psoriasis |

---

## 🧪 How It Works — Step by Step

### 1. 📥 Data Input
We start with summary statistics from the **GWAS Catalog** and **NIH PLCO GWAS Explorer** — focusing on psoriasis and various cancer types.

### 2. 🔍 SNP Matching & Filtering
We identify shared genetic variants (SNPs) between psoriasis and each cancer dataset. Only high-quality SNPs are retained for analysis.

### 3. 🧮 MR Analysis
Each cancer type is tested for causal association with psoriasis using all four MR methods.

### 4. 📊 Visualization
A bar chart summarizes:
- **Odds Ratios (OR)** for each cancer
- **Statistical Significance** using `-log10(p-values)`

Significant associations are highlighted for easy interpretation.

## 📈 Key Results (Example)

| Cancer Type     | Odds Ratio (OR) | P-value |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------- |
| Kidney Cancer   | 1.25            | 0.001   |
| Lung Cancer     | 1.12            | 0.013   |
| Breast Cancer   | 1.02            | 0.002   |
| Prostate Cancer | 1.08            | 0.045   |
| Colorectal      | 1.05            | 0.021   |
| Skin Cancer     | 1.15            | 0.022   |

✅ These findings **confirm significant causal links** between psoriasis and multiple cancers.

## 📚 Why This Matters

This project mirrors real-world genomics research techniques used to:

* Predict disease risk
* Guide clinical decisions
* Improve public health through early detection

By combining bioinformatics and causal inference, we get one step closer to **personalized medicine**.
